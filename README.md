# Global-Internet-User-Graph
This is a final project for my Data Visualization class. (Spring 2023) <br> 
I used a dataset from Kaggle and apply what I learned in class to make these graphs. <br> 
**Link to the dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishraut64/internet-users 
In class, we got to learn what is considered as a bad graph and a good graph. Until we know the basic, we got to drive into creating our own graph by utilizing Rstudio and R programming language
